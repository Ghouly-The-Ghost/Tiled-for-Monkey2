# Tiled for Monkey2

A framework agnostic, TMX/XML focused, library that assists with processing TMX Maps. 

This is not intended to be a "wrapper" for TMX maps. The goal of this library is to simplify certain patterns pertaining to Tiled files. Though, because this module is in an early state, this goal may eventually change.

*Contributions are very welcomed and encouraged as I will essentially only be adding and implementing features I personally need.*

## Getting Started
How you can get this running immediately from your computer:
**Steps**
1. Create a folder in your monkey2 modules folder named "TiledTools"
2. Open that folder in a terminal
3. **Clone:** `git clone  https://github.com/Ghouly-The-Ghost/Tiled-for-Monkey2.git .`
        _**note:** Be aware that the **"."** will clone this repository directly to the repository your terminal is in._
4. **Updating:** use `git pull` in that directory when a new major version is available.
